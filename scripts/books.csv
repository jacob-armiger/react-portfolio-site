It contains what I guess is Hemingway’s every thought on bullfighting (and other things). You won’t enjoy those thoughts unless you enjoy listening to Hemingway or have some special interest in bullfighting. I do love how he deconstructs what makes a good bullfight. It’s very well done and an interesting analysis that occasionally diverges into other humorous stories. It goes on for 400 pages, so, instead of becoming bored, I would say that after a while you get your fill of it, like food in a meal, but once you settle and your appetite returns you’re ready for more. This is the manner in which I consumed and enjoyed the book.",,,1,0

He maintains his efficient prose in this novel, and I sit comfortably in it while the protagonist, Mr. Henry, lives out the in-between moments of life where he is bored or talking with others or drinking, and it is comfortable because Hemingway so excellently writes and understands people. Then when catastrophe inevitably strikes, as it does in life, it feels visceral and important.  Perhaps my favorite read of 2024.<br/>",,,1,0

They’re about boxers, bullfighters, and old prize fighters or reflect Hemingway’s own experiences in WW1 and the Spanish Civil War. I really enjoyed the man’s man material, but behind Hemingway’s machismo subjects there are simple observations of humans and how they interact. In old fiction this gives a nice look into what kind of lives people lived (the early 20th/ late 19th century in this case). I personally enjoy getting the historical insight and parsing through what I call artifacts, which are just words or phrasing I don’t understand because how they’re being used no longer make sense in my modern senses.<br/><br/>About Hemingway’s writing, I think he’s very skilled at giving just enough information to make a scene work. I would even describe his writing as terse. It’s also heavy on dialogue, and an interesting feature of his dialogue is that he puts in repeated phrases or utterances that aren’t usually included in writing. I suppose that conflicts with my claim that he has terse prose, but Hemingway’s repetitive and circular dialogue feels like it’s used as a literary device rather than any kind of bloat.",,,1,0

Whether it’s Martian wives serving in their gendered role as household caretakers (on mars!), or the overall theme of war always being an inescapable, close thing. It’s obvious to see the influence of 1950s America on Bradbury.

Orwell wrote this novel in post-war England and depicted a future where: people live in a surveillance state, the public's perception of ""truth"" is clouded by misinformation, and humanity loses itself due to war hysteria and thirst for power.<br/><br/>Winston's (the main protagonist) monologues on the Party's use of misinformation to manipulate the public happens to be a hyperbolic reminder of today's political climate, yet to me it felt somewhat stale and long winded. He also explains the surveillance state and ""new"" technology in great detail, but once again this sounded like something I've heard before. The idea of society being under constant watch by a government entity is now a mainstream topic of debate, and the technology to do it already exists. This made even more of the book slightly tedious to read for me, although, my casual boredom speaks to Orwell's uncanny foresight on how these topics fit into modern society, and if I had read this 10 years ago I might be writing a different review.<br/><br/>Orwell also makes a point that we could lose our humanity by becoming cogs in a destructive, power-hungry machine, despite (or because of) the emergence of new technology and the abundance of resources provided by manufacturing. This would be a palpable prediction coming out of the World Wars and it's even more interesting because it's basically true during the Cold War era in the last half of the 20th century. Americans squirmed under the pretense of nuclear war and destruction, yet it became an ordinary part of life and people went about their lives. But now, in 2022, I believe that we've mostly avoided this fate. War has largely fallen out of favor (I'm thinking of the loss in Vietnam, nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from Afghanistan, and economic globalization) and, more or less, the pretense for war has withered. Now, our generation's hurdles are consumerism, equity, and climate change. In my opinion, if we lose our humanity it will be due to mindless scrolling, a corporate job, or obscurity in history.<br/><br/>As a casual reader, 1984 dragged in bits throughout, shined in the last quarter, and provided some interesting introspection, so ""I liked it"" at 3/5 stars.",,,1,0

The first and foremost being the author’s prose. Not all of it is bad, but many of his descriptions are wrought with overuse of adjectives. I also roll my eyes as a lot of his phrasing, it being over dramatic and a little cringey like something you would find in a fanfic. Toward the end of the book these problems lessen and I hope that trend continues in the rest of the trilogy. I’ll continue reading for the well-established politics, interesting characters, and complex plot that I’m sure is hiding a lot from us in the first book.",,,1,0
