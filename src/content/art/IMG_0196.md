Reference:  
*Portrait of An Aristocrat in Uniform (1785)*  
*by Joseph Ducreax*
# A Ducreax Master Study
Ducreax is known for breaking convention by creating expressive portraits. He's known for much more
expressive portraits that what I recreated above, but I like to think I captured the subdued smile of
the reference.
