# Side profile heads in ink
These heads were drawn in ink, no under sketching. Drawing in ink is a skill that people like Kim Jung Gi and Peter Han have essentially mastered. I was much worse at it when I first started practicing this way, but with repetition I’ve gotten better at it, like strengthening a muscle.  
  
I’ve asked people which head is their favorite, and I’ve gotten a variety of answers which I think is a sign that these are good. One of my favorites is the smallest head on the left side. I feel that I was able to convey the reference’s facial structure with very few lines. There’s something substantive to distilling complex forms down to as few lines as possible. Although, no one said that head was their favorite, so maybe not.
