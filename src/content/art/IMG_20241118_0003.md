title: "Gesture Maxxing"

I enjoy this sketch due to its simplification of forms and subtle gesture. The figure isn't in an extreme pose,
but the tilt of the pelvis and shoulders, raise of the arms, and turn of the head accumulate to create
a very dynamic gesture. I drew this from a photo reference, but it reminds me of the expertly elegant and subtle
gesture found in Greek statues of which I've had trouble recreating in the past.

I'd like to shore up the hesitancy you can see in the figure's lower legs. I often have trouble correctly
observing the contours of the calf and shin and around the knee. An anatomy study of the legs will
most likely suffice.
